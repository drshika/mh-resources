## Areas Needed for Contributions
Here are some areas that I think would be potentially helpful to have, however if your contribution doesn't fall under any of these, it is still valuable!

- Accommodations
 - What kinds are available
 - What MH conditions these accommodations are good for
 - How helpful is this accommodation
- Accessibility Recruiters (see [this page from the DRES Website](https://www.disability.illinois.edu/academic-supports/career-services) for more info on this)
 - Your experiences w/ Accessibility Recruiters 
 - Who can this be helpful for?
- Personal Experiences (these can be anonymous: email to me!): If you have had to navigate accommodations, getting medications or mental health resources regarding these conditions, your experiences could help future students get help!
  - Bipolar Disorder
 - Autism
 - PTSD
 - Eating Disorders
