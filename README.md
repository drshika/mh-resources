## Contribution

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/drshika/mh-resources/edit/main/index.md) to contribute text content to the website. Submit a pull request and include a description of your changes. 

Files to contribute to:
| page title   | file name       |
|--------------|-----------------|
| home         | index.md        |
| contributing | contributing.md |
| DRES         | DRES.md         |

It's probably not a good idea to touch anything else unless you are proposing a bugfix and you know what you are doing.
