A guide to mental health resources at UIUC with crowdsourced anecdotal advice. Learn more about [contributing](https://drshika.github.io/mh-resources/contributing) if you would like to help us improve this resource. 

Why? I’m a student who was denied mental health resources as a kid so I made it my mission to figure out what exactly was wrong with me and how to fix it when I arrived on campus. Through my journey, I’ve learned some things that I thought would be useful to compile into a guide that the UIUC community can use and contribute to!

This guide also includes anecdotal advice from various contributors which are not substitutes for medical advice.

## Diagnosis and Treatment

Here is anecdotal (unless otherwise indicated) information about how to get diagnosed and treated for various mental conditions. 



1. Depression
    - Start at the counseling center who will give you a referral to either a private practice or McKinley psychiatrists for screening. 
    - You should go see an MD at McKinley to get official medical documentation of your illness. Are you currently treating your depression with any meds? If not, I'd suggest asking your MD about that too. I felt a world of a difference when I started medicine and was surprised at how much it helped. \
      I also highly recommend DRES. Are you signed up with them? They're a great resource and do A LOT to help you with your academic goals, taking time off, medical leave, etc while having a disability. And trust me, depression is a serious illness and disability-- you deserve accommodations! I just signed up with DRES and am getting accommodations and it's really helping. (via u/miimijae on reddit)
2. Anxiety
    - Start at the counseling center who will give you a referral to either a private practice or McKinley psychiatrists for screening. 
    - My personal experience is if you’ve already been to the counseling center you have to get the person that you’ve been seeing to recommend you for a screening at DRES. If you just fill out the form online and your counselor from the center doesn’t recommend you- you’ll just get told it’s a mood disorder and to keep seeing the counseling center. That’s what happened to me. \
    I went to outside therapist in downtown Champaign, for adhd and mood testing. I got an official diagnosis of anxiety, and then brought that to DRES and got accommodations. It was a process of about 2 months at a cost after insurance of $500. Definitely worth it though. - (via u/Tris42 on reddit)
3. ADHD
    - Start at the counseling center who will give you a referral to either a private practice or DRES for screening. 
    - Basically what I did was went to their website which is elliottcounselinggroup.com and scrolled down and used the contact us feature and said I wanted to be evaluated for ADHD. They emailed me back within a couple days, and we set up an appointment with one of the nurse practitioners. \
      After the first appointment, you have to do lab work because they have to test for anemia and low vitamin D before they can treat you. This can be done at McKinley, and it does not take long at all. The paperwork at McKinley took longer. \
      Your results will come back quickly, and you will take an ADHD self evaluation form. At this point, you and your provider will decide the next steps, which for me was medication. \
      I only pay a copay of $25, but this is with insurance. I believe insurance is kind of necessary to go this route. \
      They are really nice at Elliott Counseling Group, and my appointments are very chill and all under 20 mins. (via u/wopil on reddit)
    - [https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/7tqjiw/what_to_do_if_you_think_you_have_adhd_some_other/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/7tqjiw/what_to_do_if_you_think_you_have_adhd_some_other/)
4. Autism
    - As of 9/30, Phone screenings for Autism are free at the Pyschological Services Center: https://psc.illinois.edu/autism-spectrum-assessment-services/
    - I've personally been on the waitlist for around 6 mo and have yet to hear back 
    - Reddit user said Carle does screenings for Autism (but may have long waitlist)
    - DRES does free screenings for Autism after you get registered with them. See more info here: https://www.disability.illinois.edu/academic-supports/supports-students-autism on what services you can get re: Auxiliary aids, Therapy and Academic/Career Counseling.  \**this process only works if you have not previously been registered with DRES
    - Screening vs Diagnosis: Screening is a 1x process that is used to asses whether the individual is at "risk" for having autism. Diagnosis is an intensive process that happens over multiple appointments and conducted in person by a clinician with expertise in Autism. Assesments include behavioral interviews, written assesments and clinical observations. 

## Outside of School Diagnosis

Often times, UIUC routes of diagnosis are time consuming and you just want to get your accomodations and move on with life. Here are some sites you can get your diagnosis at. Make sure you share the official reports with your access specialist at DRES and set up an appointment to discuss changes to your letter of accomodation!

**ADHD**
- https://www.klarityadhd.com/evaluation?ref_internal=navBarEvaluationButton
    - at the time of writing this guide, the charge for the appointment was $149 with two visits included
    - if you are getting meds w/no insurance, I highly reccomend using GoodRX to get a discount (via author)
**AUTISM**
- https://embrace-autism.com/autism-assessments/
